## Seal Paradise Progress

* Trying to implent UI, so easy configuration for disabling stuff.
* Implement Certain item ESP.
* Stealing from other scripts of the game i wont tell is my option, i may remodify.
* Warning messages
* possibly room telling, like, if it finds the thing in the room, the message says which room is it.
* Private access. The code logs each person trying to access it...
* Trolling stuff??? For some stuff.
* Gootraxian and human esp.
* Opening doors from really far distance. mainly i suppose proximity ones. ill see about the sensor ones
* a fashion of crediting myself.
* certain choice of infections. i wont proclaim what. especially, if its the crytal one, it will be easy since you can use crytals and abuse the code to infect you even if youre not on it. such as soap, crystal, the doo doo, shrok? i wont proclaim what kind of. mainly, its going to be hard since it needs to abuse hitbox sizes and idk its going to make it cliented sided.
* trolling stuff like i said, if you have admin access in priv server, you can troll ppl that cant see command list. like playing knockinf noises or shit
* silent use of priv server commands. but still, the command is simply seen in command history, ps, it just adds /e to the command.
* i need to drink
